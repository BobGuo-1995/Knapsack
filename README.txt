# Knapsack
You are given a knapsack of capacity W and n items with weights {wi} and values {vi}. The goal is to identify a subset of the items S with maximal value, equal to P i∈S vi , subject to the constraint that P i∈S wi ≤ W. Each item may be included at most once (each is either included or not included in S).
